## How to Write a Description to an Image with Exiv2

**Exiv2** is a powerful command-line tool for reading, writing, and manipulating image metadata. In this guide, we'll learn how to use Exiv2 to write a description to an image file.

### 1. Open a Terminal

First, open a terminal window on your Linux system. Make sure you have Exiv2 installed. If not, you can typically install it using your distribution's package manager.

### 2. Locate Your Image

Navigate to the directory where your image file is located using the `cd` command. For example:

```
cd /home/user/pictures
```

### 3. Write the Description

Use the following command to write a description to your image file:

```
exiv2 -M"set Exif.Image.ImageDescription $description" your_image.jpg
```

Replace `your_image.jpg` with the actual name of your image file, and `$description` with the description you want to write.

**Note:** You can also use single quotes instead of double quotes for the description.

### 4. Verify the Description

You can verify that the description was written successfully by using the `exiv2 -pt` command with your image file:

```
exiv2 -pt your_image.jpg
```

This command will print all the metadata tags in the image, including the `Exif.Image.ImageDescription` tag.

### Example

Here's an example of adding a description to an image file named "photo.jpg":

```
exiv2 -M"set Exif.Image.ImageDescription 'This is a beautiful photo of a sunset'" photo.jpg

exiv2 -pt photo.jpg | grep Description
```

The second command will print the description, which should display the text you entered.

### Remember

Writing descriptions to your images can be helpful for organization, searching, and sharing your photos. It's always a good practice to add relevant information about your images whenever possible.
