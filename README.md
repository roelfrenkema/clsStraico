# Documentation clsStraico.php

## BETA VERSION

This is a new beta version of clsStraico. V2.0.0b
It is (should be) usable atm. Just clone it and run straicoprompt.php in 
its directory.
Documentation and other candy needs work as their has been a lot of 
changes. But the class is well documented and I will work on it more in
the comming days. 

As you can see there is a hugchatprompt.php too. This is not useable at 
the moment. I am working on this too.
